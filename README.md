I created these LPIC-1 labs on my own Linux machine to get hands-on practice with hardware-related topics covered in the certification. Below, youâ€™ll find a breakdown of what I did in each lab, what I learned, and why it matters. Iâ€™ve also marked spots with a ðŸ“¸ emoji where I took screenshots to include in my GitHub repo.

For reference, Iâ€™ve included the following helpful links:

Letâ€™s get into it!

ðŸ”¸ Part 1: Enable/Disable Integrated Peripherals

I rebooted and entered the BIOS/UEFI (pressed "Del" for mine). Inside the Integrated Peripherals section, I found toggles for USB controllers, network cards, and onboard audio.

What I learned: Itâ€™s important to know how to access and control these settings outside the OS. Useful for troubleshooting when a device isnâ€™t even being detected.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot BIOS screen showing peripheral options.

ðŸ”¸ Part 2: Identify Mass Storage Devices

I ran the lsblk and fdisk -l commands to check out my drives. Then I plugged in a USB stick and saw it show up as /dev/sdb.

What I learned: Good practice to spot the difference between SSDs, HDDs, loop devices, and USBs using command-line tools.

ðŸ”¸ Part 3: Check Hardware Resources

I checked system resource usage with:

cat /proc/interrupts for IRQs

cat /proc/ioports

cat /proc/dma

What I learned: These files show how devices are connected and using resources. This can help figure out conflicts or issues with certain hardware.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot of cat /proc/interrupts.

ðŸ”¸ Part 4: List Hardware Info

I ran the following:

lspci and lsusb to list PCI and USB devices

lshw -short for a quick system summary

lscpu and free -h for CPU and memory

dmidecode for BIOS and system details

What I learned: These are quick and powerful tools for checking what hardware you have and how itâ€™s performingâ€”all from the terminal.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot of lshw -short or lspci.

ðŸ”¸ Part 5: Manage USB Devices

Plugged in a USB stick, mounted it to /mnt/usb, and then unmounted it. I used both traditional and udisksctl commands.

What I learned: Mounting and unmounting correctly is key to keeping USB data safe. Also nice to know how to power down a USB port.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot showing mounted USB in lsblk.

ðŸ”¸ Part 6: Explore sysfs, udev, and dbus

I checked network interface details in /sys/class/net

Ran udevadm info and udevadm monitor to see device events

Used dbus-monitor to watch system messages

What I learned: These tools show how Linux tracks devices behind the scenes. You can actually see the kernel reacting when you plug or unplug something.
