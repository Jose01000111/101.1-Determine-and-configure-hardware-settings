# üß™ LPIC-1 Lab: Topic 101.1 Determine and Configure Hardware Settings

I created these LPIC-1 labs on my own Linux machine to get hands-on practice with hardware-related topics covered in the certification. Below, you‚Äôll find a breakdown of what I did in each lab, what I learned, and why it matters. 

I‚Äôve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

### üî∏ Part 1: Enable/Disable Integrated Peripherals

I rebooted and entered the BIOS/UEFI (pressed "Esc" key for mine). Inside the Integrated Peripherals section, I found toggles for USB controllers, network cards, and onboard audio.

What I learned: It‚Äôs important to know how to access and control these settings outside the OS. Useful for troubleshooting when a device isn‚Äôt even being detected.

Also here is what the GRUB (Bootloader) looks like:

### üî∏ Part 2: Identify Mass Storage Devices

I ran the lsblk and fdisk -l commands to check out my drives. Then I plugged in a USB stick and saw it show up as /dev/sdb.

What I learned: Good practice to spot the difference between SSDs, HDDs, loop devices, and USBs using command-line tools.

### üî∏ Part 3: Check Hardware Resources

I checked system resource usage with:

cat /proc/interrupts for IRQs

cat /proc/ioports

cat /proc/dma

![1fJJ2jY](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f9bc116-2df1-4ac7-b018-c1c0c5de9788)


What I learned: These files show how devices are connected and using resources. This can help figure out conflicts or issues with certain hardware.

### üî∏ Part 4: List Hardware Info

I ran the following:

lspci and lsusb to list PCI and USB devices

lshw -short for a quick system summary

lscpu and free -h for CPU and memory

dmidecode for BIOS and system details

![LwadXQE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c32e1bfd-aea5-4a50-b831-1474fde241d4)

What I learned: These are quick and powerful tools for checking what hardware you have and how it‚Äôs performing‚Äîall from the terminal.

### üî∏ Part 5: Manage USB Devices

###  üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Incident ‚Äì USB Mount Commands on CentOS
While working on Part 5: Mount and Unmount USB Devices, I noticed that commands like udisksctl didn‚Äôt work on my CentOS VM. Turns out, CentOS doesn‚Äôt include desktop-focused tools like udisks2 by default, since it's a server-oriented OS.

To fix this, I‚Äôd need to install udisks2 manually or stick to basic commands like mount and umount with the correct device paths. This was a helpful reminder that tools vary across distros, so knowing your environment is just as important as knowing the commands.

Plugged in a USB stick, mounted it to /mnt/usb, and then unmounted it. I used both traditional and udisksctl commands.

What I learned: Mounting and unmounting correctly is key to keeping USB data safe. Also nice to know how to power down a USB port.

### üî∏ Part 6: Explore sysfs, udev, and dbus

I checked network interface details in /sys/class/net

Ran udevadm info and udevadm monitor to see device events

Used dbus-monitor to watch system messages

![mG0oYSB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42e1d85-0bef-4339-84fa-47fa07a3bc81)

What I learned: These tools show how Linux tracks devices behind the scenes. You can actually see the kernel reacting when you plug or unplug something.
